## 🎯 How to Play
- Use the arrow buttons on the screen or the keyboard arrow keys (W, A, S, D) to slide all tiles in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right).
- When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their values.
- A new tile (either a 2 or a 4) appears in a random empty spot on the board after every move.
- The game is won when you create a tile with the value **2048** 🏆.
- The game ends when the board is full and no more moves are possible.
